“Natural event tracker” project application is a web-based application through which we
will able to get all the reports related to natural event of any locations. Tracking of
natural events in real-time is something that has been made possible since humans
launched satellites, organizations like NASA have real time information of natural
events occurring anywhere on earth. This data ranges from volcanic eruptions, storm
events, wildfires, extreme snow, landslides etc., but this data is available in text form,
with our project we aim to give this data from NASA a visual representation on maps.
This would help us to easily navigate the data across different places of the world We
achieve this by making use of NASA EONET API and goggle maps API, the data about
natural events received from the EONET API is used to create co-responding visual
representation on the map
